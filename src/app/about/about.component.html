<h1>About SLWG</h1>

<p>The St. Louis Woodworkers Guild is a nonprofit organization. Membership is open to all having interest in working
  with wood. Since its founding in 1984, the Guild has grown to a membership of about 250 woodworkers from the
  beginning amateur to the skilled professional.</p>

<h2>Goals</h2>

<h3>Education</h3>

<p>The SLWG seeks to improve the craftsmanship of its members through <strong>monthly meetings</strong> with
  instructional presentations by members and outside experts.</p>

<p>Each year we sponsor a <strong>weekend seminar/workshop with a renowned expert</strong>. In the past we have hosted
  noted woodworkers such as <a href="http://frankklausz.com/" target="_blank">Frank Klausz</a>,
  <a href="http://marcadams.com/" target="_blank">Marc Adams</a>,
  <a href="http://www.blackburnbooks.com/Product/Non-Fiction.html" target="_blank">Graham Blackburn</a>, and
  <a href="http://www.homesteadfinishingproducts.com/htdocs/jewitt.htm" target="_blank">Jeff Jewitt</a>.</p>

<p>The guild has established a <strong>mentor program</strong> by pairing more experienced members with beginners to
  woodworking. Furthering this concept, we have setup a program where members host <strong>mini-workshops</strong> in
  their home or workshop to teach fellow members about a specific topic in woodworking.</p>

<h3>Service</h3>

<p>The Guild also provides service to the community through a <strong>toy building program</strong> in which toys
  built by members are distributed to children in local area hospitals. We also perform volunteer work at the
  historic village at <strong>Faust Park</strong>. We have a dedicated space in the park where we have established a
  workshop to support renovation efforts as well as member education. Several members of the Guild perform volunteer
  work at the <strong>St. Louis Museum of Transportation</strong>. They primarily perform wood restoration on a
  variety of unique, vintage railroad cars and equipment that are displayed there.</p>
